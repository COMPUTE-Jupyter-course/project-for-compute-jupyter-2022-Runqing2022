This is the project work for Course <u> Reproducible and Interactive Data Analysis and Modelling using Jupyter Notebooks (NATF017)</u>. 

This project focuses on phase reconstruction of coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) and visualization of reconstructed images from ptychography using Ptypy. In the first part, Error reduction (ER) and Hybrid-Input-Output (HIO) algorithms are introduced, python code included for the reconstruction process. With the interact function, the different result is visualization casued by adjusting the parameters. The second part introduces ptychography, and the ptypy package used for reconstruction. This project does not include the reconstruction process, only showing the impact of different binning numbers and algorithms on the reconstruction results.
